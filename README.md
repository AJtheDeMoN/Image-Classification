## Dataset

The project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/Jaiswal0786/Image-Classification.git`

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install the dependencies:

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:


4. Open the `Image_Classification.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.

5. Execute the notebook cells to see the image classification process.

## Usage

The notebook provides an example of how to perform image classification using a CNN model. It includes the following steps:

1. Loading and preprocessing the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. Building and training the CNN model.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it as needed for your own projects.
